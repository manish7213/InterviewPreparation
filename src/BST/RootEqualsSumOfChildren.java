/**
 * You are given the root of a binary tree that consists of exactly 3 nodes: the root, its left child, and its right child.
 * Return true if the value of the root is equal to the sum of the values of its two children, or false otherwise
 * <p>
 * Input: root = [10,4,6]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The values of the root, its left child, and its right child are 10, 4, and 6, respectively.
 * 10 is equal to 4 + 6, so we return true.
 * <p>
 * Input: root = [5,3,1]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: The values of the root, its left child, and its right child are 5, 3, and 1, respectively.
 * 5 is not equal to 3 + 1, so we return false.
